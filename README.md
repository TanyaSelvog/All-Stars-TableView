# All-Stars-TableView

This project shows the players involved in the MLS All-Stars 2021 game.

I created it as a way to practice a few things, including:
  - setting up a TableView using Scene Builder
  - making columns in a TableView show data
  - adding and removing data
  - how to determine & manipulate selected rows.
